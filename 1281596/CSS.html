		<span>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the main markup language for creating web page and other information that can be displayes in a web browser.

		HTML is written in the form of HTML. elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle bracket (like <<!- ->html>), within the web page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <<!- ->h1> and <<!- ->/h1>, although some tags represent empty element and so are unpaired, for example <<!- ->img>. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). In between these tags web designers can add text further tags. comments and other types of text-based content.
